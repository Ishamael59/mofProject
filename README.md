#mofProject
This is my project for code louisville. 
The purpose of this app is to replace a very large paper flowchart used for
evaluating a failed customer module,  with a small application that can be
run on mobile devices as well as any web browser. 

The web app will prompt the user for a question then wait for a reply. At that point, the user input
will trigger the next question in the logic path until a 'failure code' is established.
