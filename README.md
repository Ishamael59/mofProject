#mofProject
This is my project for code louisville. 
The purpose of this app is to replace a very large paper flowchart (30+ questions) used for
evaluating a failed customer power module with a small application that can be
run on any web browser 

The web app will prompt the user for a question then wait for a reply. At that point, the user input
will trigger the next question in the logic path until a 'failure code' is established. At that point the user
can restart the application for the next unit analysys.
